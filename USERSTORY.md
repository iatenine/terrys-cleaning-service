As a user, I want to be able to visit a web page for Terry's Maid Service, learn about the company, how to contact the business and submit a request for a quote

```
WHEN I view the top of the page
THEN I should see a sticky navbar with links to the following sections: About, Services, Request a Quote

WHEN I click a link on the navbar
THEN the page should scroll to the relevant section

WHEN I load the page
THEN a hero image should appear just below the navbar

WHEN I view Request a Quote
THEN I am presented with a form with fields for Name, email, phone number and message

WHEN I fill out the Request a Quote form
THEN the submit button is disabled until Name and email are filled out with validated input

WHEN I submit the Request a Quote form
THEN an email is sent to a specified address with the relevant information

WHEN I view the footer
THEN contact info is displayed including Name, address, contact number and operating hours
```
